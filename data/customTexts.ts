  warning: `Hey!\n\nThe squad took heavy damage because you missed a great number of dailies :sweat:  It's okay to a have bad or busy day now and then, but in that case it's best to spend the day at the inn. If you need some support from the squad, let the other members know why you're resting at the inn by posting inside the #inn channel.\nIf you often failed to meet a great number of dailies, it's also a sign that you may need to disable (at least temporarily) some dailies and focus on some core dailies.\n\nSince every member has only 50 HP, we automatically send this message when >8 damage is dealt to the squad. When too much damage is dealt in a short time span, members may die overnight.\n\nAll right, let's not dwell on the past. Now get back into the game and rebuild those streaks! :smiley:\n\n__This is an automatic message__`,
